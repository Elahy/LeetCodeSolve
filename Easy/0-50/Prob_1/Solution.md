## Solution Using Dictionary

We traverse through the given nums array.
for each element we check if the difference between current number and the Target is already present in our dictionary

# if the the complement or the difference between the target and the current number present in dictionary we return their index as an array.

# else We add the current number as key and it's index as value to the dictionary
