## Here we are keeping trac of two things

# Maximum Profit

# Minimum Price

in each itaration we compare the current price with both MaxProfit and MinPrice
if current Price is lower than minimum price we got before then we update the minimum price woth current price
and if the difference between current price and minPrice is greater than maxProfit we got so far than we update the maxProfit with the difference (new profit).

# Finally we return the max Profit
