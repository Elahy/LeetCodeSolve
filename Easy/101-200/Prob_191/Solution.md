# This is a bit Manipulation Problem

Here we are Running a loop untill n is 0
In each operation we are doing a bitwise AND operation of n & 1
Here if the last bit of n is 1 we will get a 1
We add that one to our bits count

    After that we perform a right shift of n by 1

# Finally we return bits count
